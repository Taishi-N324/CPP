The main building in 1940 . In the back is a Type 89 naval attack aircraft and in the foreground is a Type 92 fighter . 
brief personal record 
The year of its establishment is said to be 1881 ( Meiji 14 ) , when the Tokyo Shokuhin Gakko was founded . The origin of the school can be traced further back to the `` Production School '' established in 1874 at the suggestion of Gottfried Wagener in the Tokyo Kaisei Gakko [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . 
On June 10 , 1882 , the Ministry of Education granted the school the Asakusa Bunko building in Kuramae Higashi Katamachi , Asakusa-ku , Tokyo , and construction of a new school building began . In the early Meiji period , there were only two industrial educational institutions : the Industrial Technology College ( the predecessor of the University of Tokyo 's Faculty of Engineering ) and the Tokyo Vocational Institute of Technology . While the former , staffed by Englishmen , aimed to train leaders in land management such as mining , civil engineering , and telegraph , the latter , based on a survey of technical education in the continental European countries of Britain , Germany , and France , was conceived by Seiichi Teshima and other Japanese and was established with two departments , the Chemical Engineering Department and the Mechanical Engineering Department , for the purpose of training leaders in manufacturing and industrial education . The latter was conceived by Seiichi Teshima and other Japanese based on a survey of technical education in continental European countries such as Britain , Germany , and France . 
In 1923 , the school was devastated by the Great Kanto Earthquake and moved outside the city to Ookayama , Hirosu-mura , Ebara-gun , Tokyo . In 1929 , the university was promoted to a public university . It was regarded as one of the `` old three engineering universities '' along with Lushun Institute of Technology and Osaka Institute of Technology . In 1949 , after the Pacific War , the university was transferred to the new system . In 2018 , it will become a designated national university corporation .

main point 
World 's first observation of the moment when two different types of atoms combine to form heteronuclear polyatomic molecules 
Direct observation of the smallest three-element alloy containing one atom each of gold-silver-copper by annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy ( ADF-STEM ) used in this study 
Expectations for catalyst mechanism elucidation and design through the elucidation of unknown atomic assemblies 
summary 
A research group led by Associate Professor Kyotoshi Imaoka , Professor Kimihisa Yamamoto , and graduate students Miki Inazu and Yuji Akada of the Department of Applied Chemistry , School of Materials Science and Engineering , Tokyo Institute of Technology , has observed the bonding of different metal atoms in real time using a high-resolution electron microscope . This technique has also made it possible to observe the bonding of different metal atoms in real time . Using this technique , they also succeeded in directly observing AuAgCu , the smallest three-element alloy containing one atom each of Au , Ag , and Cu , which had not been possible before . 
The vast knowledge of compounds obtained by the formation and cleavage of interatomic bonds is the basis of today 's organic , complex , and inorganic chemistry . In recent years , it has been particularly important to know `` what kind of aggregates are formed transiently , '' because in many cases , unstable metal atom aggregates , which are formed only transiently , are considered to be the true active species in catalytic reactions . However , it is extremely difficult to observe their presence and analyze their structure unless they are stably bound compounds . 
In this study , samples of various metal atoms dispersed on graphene were prepared , and the bonding was observed in real-time moving images using an electron microscope with a resolution that allows observation of atoms . By appropriately processing the recorded movies , the type of element in each moving atom was identified , and the type and structure of the molecules that were formed one after another during the observation were determined . 
This method , which enables the observation of metastable structures even in transient metal aggregates that can not be stably isolated , is expected to lead to the elucidation of previously unknown elements that form atomic aggregates and their formation processes , and to the elucidation of catalytic mechanisms and new designs . The research results were published in the online edition of the British scientific journal Nature Communications on May 27 . 
background 
The formation and cleavage of atomic bonds is the essence of chemistry , and the knowledge of the structures and reactions of the vast number of compounds that have been isolated to date is the basis of today 's organic , complex , and inorganic chemistry . The study of such chemical bonding can usually only be done by synthesizing stable molecules or solids and analyzing their structures . In catalytic science , in particular , there are many cases in which unstable metal atoms , which are formed only transiently and transiently , are considered to be the true active species in catalytic reactions , and it has been an important issue to know what kind of assemblies are formed in these cases in particular . The observation of atomic resolution dynamics using electron microscopy was considered to be a very powerful technique for observing the interatomic bonding of such unstable materials . 
Recent advances in aberration correction techniques have made it possible to directly observe atomic dynamics through successive atomic image observations . In the structures of successively generated atomic arrangements observed by this method , many structures with arrangements and bonding distances consistent with those of calculated chemistry have been observed . However , elemental identification of a single atom is required to observe heteroatomic bonding by this method . 
EDS ( energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ) and EELS ( electron energy loss spectroscopy ) are the most common analytical methods that enable elemental identification when combined with electron microscopy . However , although elemental mapping of atomic columns and identification of single atoms by irradiation with high electron doses have been reported , neither method can be applied to the identification of moving atoms due to problems of detection sensitivity and sample damage caused by electron irradiation , and the only way to determine how each element is arranged in a molecule ( cluster ) consisting of metal atoms is to predict the arrangement of each element by The only way to determine the arrangement of each element in a molecule ( cluster ) of metal atoms was to predict it by molecular orbital calculations , etc . 
In this study , the annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy ( ADF-STEM ) method [ term 1 ] , in which the luminosity of a single atom correlates with its atomic number , was employed as an observation method for structural analysis of such metal-assembly molecules composed of multiple elements . Since atoms move moment by moment during observation , we performed a tracking analysis of moving images in which the luminance is measured while tracking the coordinates of the atoms ( Figure 1 ) .

Figure 1 : Observation of metal atom aggregates using ADF-STEM method 
Research Methodology and Results 
1. correlation between luminance measurement of single atoms and atomic number 
In the ADF-STEM method , atoms are observed as bright bright spots , and their brightness is said to be proportional to the nth power of the atomic number ( n is a number between 1 and 2 ) . We observed a large number of gold , silver , and copper atoms supported on graphene , respectively , and took atomic brightness distributions of the images after appropriate noise and background removal . Each was found to have a near-normal distribution , and each mode was found to be proportional to the 1.15 power of the atomic number Z , in good agreement with the correlation predicted from the ADF-STEM simulations . The errors in the brightness of each atom obtained from the tracking analysis of the movies were sufficiently small to discriminate gold , silver , and copper atoms from each other with better than 99 % accuracy . 
2. demonstration of metal-atom bonding 
When gold , silver , and copper atoms deposited on graphene were observed in moving images , the atoms constantly move around on the graphene surface , bonding and separating from each other . According to the movie ( Figure 2A ) , the atoms appear to attract and bond with each other when they approach a certain distance . To understand the pattern of this motion , we investigated the statistics of the distance between two gold atoms in one movie frame ( Figure 2B ) and the frequency of whether the bonding extends or contracts in the next frame . As shown in ( Figure 2C ) , in most cases , the distance between the two atoms is distributed with a mode value of about 0.26 nm , which is the bonding distance of the gold dimer , and as shown in ( Figure 2D ) , the frequency of bond stretching and shrinking switches around that distance . This indicates that when the distance is farther than the equilibrium inter-nuclear distance ( 0.26 nm ) , an attractive force is exerted between the atoms .

( A ) Sequential images of a gold atom dimer , ( B ) time variation of the distance between two gold atoms , ( C ) histograms of each interatomic distance counted separately for a decrease ( positive ) and an increase ( negative ) of the distance in the next frame , ( D ) histogram showing the difference between the positive and negative histograms in panel ( C ) .

3. direct observation of diatomic and triatomic molecules using ADF-STEM method 
Bonds were continuously formed and broken between atoms . Bonds were formed not only between atoms of the same kind but also between different kinds of atoms , and a total of 24 kinds of homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules were directly observed for the first time ( Figure 3 ) . Furthermore , for the first time in the world , triatomic molecules consisting of one atom each of gold , silver , and copper , which are monetary metals that normally do not phase separate to form uniform alloys in bulk metals , were also successfully observed ( Fig . 4 ) .

Future Development 
In this research , the bonding of different metal atoms was observed in real time for the first time in the world using a high-resolution electron microscope observation method that can clearly determine the position of metal elements . Using this technique , the researchers also succeeded in directly observing AuAgCu , the smallest three-element alloy containing one atom each of Au , Ag , and Cu , which had not been possible before . This technique is expected to contribute to the structural elucidation of inorganic materials with amorphous structures , such as metal sub-nanoparticles ( clusters ) , and to lead to the design of new catalysts . 
glossary 
[ Annular Dark Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ( ADF-STEM ) : A type of electron microscope ( EM ) in which a sample is irradiated with an electron beam instead of light and observed with high precision using an electron lens . The sample is scanned using a narrowly focused electron beam , and the transmitted electron beam is detected to observe the sample . Since electron beams scattered at high angles are detected using a ring-shaped detector , atoms with larger atomic numbers , which have stronger thermal diffuse scattering , the main cause of electron beam scattering at high angles , can be observed more clearly , and metallic atoms with larger and heavier atomic numbers can be clearly distinguished from lighter non-metallic atoms . In addition , by focusing the electron beam to the size of an atom , observation at the one-atom level of resolution becomes possible .

A day in the life of an undergraduate or graduate student 
Do you know what Tokyo Tech students do every day ? 
Tokyo Tech students are often thought of as being all about studying . 
They seem to spend their time in a variety of ways , including hobbies , clubs , and part-time jobs . 
Let 's take a look at one such day in the life of a Tokyo Tech student ! 
Example of an undergraduate student 
Morning at the dorm ! 
One of Tokyo Tech 's dormitories , Shofu Gakuen , is located in Aoba-ku , Yokohama . It takes about an hour to get to the Ookayama campus on foot and by train , so it may be a little difficult on days when you have first period . But when that happens , one of the dormitory 's strengths is that you can be woken up by your dormitory friends . 
Morning at the dorm ! 
And a little bit of a different kind of class . 
This is a unique Tokyo Tech class in which students listen to a lecture by a prominent guest once a week and discuss it in small groups . Have you ever thought seriously about your `` aspirations '' ? This class is designed to help you find the answer to that question .

What are you doing with your spare time ? 
Free periods '' are a familiar part of university life . At Tokyo Tech , where each class period is 90 minutes long , students use their free time in a variety of ways . Some students prepare and review for classes , some go out to eat , and others work on muscle training . 
What are you doing with your spare time ? 
What do you do part-time ? 
International student Song Ji-hwan has worked part-time in a factory , as an examiner , and at concerts , and is currently working in a restaurant . Through his experiences of failure , he has acquired cooking skills and gained recognition for his abilities . This has given me confidence and I enjoy my job . My income is mainly used for rent . While securing time to study , she is also gaining an understanding of the Japanese temperament , social structure , and customs through her part-time job . 
What do you do part-time ? 
Graduate Student Example 
Master 's Coursework 
Master 's Coursework 
Master 's Coursework 
In some master 's programs , all tests and reports are in English , so you will need to be able to read and write scientific and technical texts in English . It is also necessary to be able to balance your own research schedule with class assignments . We often see students collaborating on assignments with their peers in the lab . 
Laboratory Experiments 
The difficult part of experimental research is that you have to think about the construction of the experimental apparatus and the setting of the conditions by yourself . You will advance your research by studying related papers , presenting the results of your experiments , and discussing them with your supervisor . In the master 's program , even if the theme or field of study changes , the experience of research in the laboratory to which you belong from the fourth year of the bachelor 's program will come alive . Conversely , the environment is one in which students are evaluated on the premise that they have mastered research attitudes and methodologies .

Wooden gear clocks 
Tenmaru Saito 
Class 4 Bachelor 1 year 
His hobby is to do wooden crafts . During the process , he does not use electricity and does it by hand . Why wood ? He says it is because he is attached to nature , having worked in the fields at his parents ' home . He has been developing the idea of a gear-type clock since he was in the 6th grade of elementary school , and now he is making the parts at the Monozukuri Education and Research Support Center and at home .

Love affairs of Tokyo Tech students 
Tokyo Institute of Technology has an overwhelmingly male student population . Perhaps because of the lack of female students , there seems to be a difference between men and women in terms of romantic relationships . In this survey , about 40 % of the girls have dated a Tokyo Tech student . 
Tokyo Tech has an image of being all about studying , but you may even see on-campus couples on campus ! 
Are you currently dating anyone ? 
Have you ever dated a Tokyo Tech student ?
